    Introduction to the Life of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH)
</h1>

<p>
  Asslamu alaykum! Welcome to ‘the introduction to the life of Prophet Muhammad
  (Peace be upon him).’ There has never been a human being so well-respected,
  loved and followed as Muhammad (pbuh), the final messenger of Allah. There has
  never been a person who has changed world history so dramatically as Muhammad
  (pbuh) and his message. The Prophet (pbuh) was the single most important
  person in the history of the world.
</p>

<p>
  The reason for Muhammad’s (pbuh) success was that he was sent with a pure
  message from Allah, the creator of all mankind. This message would help us
  understand how to live our lives. It would tell us about good and bad and
  about wrong and right. This message would tell us about mankind (about you and
  me), the universe and the rest of creation around us. This message would tell
  us about Allah and about our relationship with Allah. The message also told us
  about the Hereafter, the Day of Judgment, Heaven and Hell.
</p>

  The Qu'ran is this pure message that was revealed to Muhammad 1400 years ago.

  The Qu'ran is this pure message that was revealed to Muhammad 1400 years ago.
  These are the words of Allah that were sent to the prophet Muhammad (pbuh).
  Allah has guarded it and kept it pure from changes and errors. The purpose or
  mission of the prophet (pbuh) was to deliver this message to Mankind and to
  follow its teachings.

<h2>
  There is no other message that has such an impact on mankind as the Qu’ran.

  There is no other message that has such an impact on mankind as the Qu’ran.
  There are no other revealed books that have been kept pure from changes like
  the Qu’ran has. The Qu’ran has changed the lives of billions of people in the
  world. It has helped them become better people and live according to the will
  of Allah.

<h3>Many prophets that came before prophet Muhammad</h3>
<p>
  There were many prophets that came before prophet Muhammad (pbuh) - 124,000 we
  are told from Hadith. The Qu’ran tells us that every nation was sent a
  prophet. The mission of the prophets was to tell their people about Allah and
  invite them to live their lives according to Allah’s command. This helped them
  be good and generous people who looked after and cared for each other. The
  good people would be rewarded with heaven and the people that rebelled and
  refused the prophet would be punished with hellfire.
</p>

<h4>Messengers upon messengers</h4>
<p>
  When the prophet died, the people would forget part of the message and then
  add bits to the original message. Eventually, the messages became completely
  different and the people went astray again. Allah would send another messenger
  to guide them back to the right path.
</p>

<h5>Seal of prophethood</h5>
<p>
  This cycle of prophets coming and the people going astray continued for a long
  time. When Muhammad (pbuh) came, the cycle was broken. The big difference was
  that the message of Muhammad (pbuh) was for everyone and would never change.
  If the people went astray, they could turn back to the original message (the
  Qu’ran) and be guided again. If they did not understand things they could look
  into the Sunnah which is a practical guide of how the Qu'ran is followed.
