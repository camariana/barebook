  <p>
    <strong>Neglect not your time, nor use it haphazardly</strong>; on the contrary you should bring yourself to account. <em>Structure your litanies and other practices during each day and night</em>. This is how to bring about the spiritual blessing (barakah) in each period.
    If each of your breaths is a priceless jewel, be not like the deceived fools who are joyous because each day their wealth increases while their life grows ever shorter.
